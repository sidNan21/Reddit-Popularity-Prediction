The first week of February I fell ill with these these symptoms that proceeded as following, started with loose stools the next day it progressed to fever and body aches which lasted roughly 3 days, towards the end of day 3 I developed a dry cough which 2 days later progressed to a moderate case of pneumonia, I was over everything within 10 days. The kicker is I had 3 different flu swabs at the beginning of it, all negative.

It's not entirely clear how much a difference hospitalization will make on the mortality rate. But it is also possible that the measures we all take will cause as much, or more, harm for society as a whole.\n\nFar too many people's livelihoods are directly tied to their ability to go out and work. Most Americans can't survive a few weeks without work to self quarantine. Companies are cancelling events. For hourly people that's basically the same as a pay cut or a layoff. Companies, some of them, are starting to fire people. Many are pausing hiring. People will lose their homes and take on excessive debt to try and keep food on the table.\n\nMaybe I'm cynical, but I strongly expect that, in the end, there will be little difference in the percentage infected/mortality rate when comparing different locations responses to the disease and areas with the most aggressive policies designed to prevent the spread of the disease will be worse off for their efforts. The curves might look different, but so will the amount of time the area spends taking these measures.\n\nTime will tell. I'll gladly admit if the evidence shows I'm wrong.",

                "body": "Anyone know how to make this a thread? ppl asked and i have no idea\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni will give you guys an idea what extent the Chinese went with their lock-down, especially in Wuhan, to successfully contain this virus:\n\n1. Each community would have its own whatsapp group ( wechat), every member of that group need to report body temperature taken daily ( this is for the whole country). Any symptoms at all need to be reported. For any unit that has ppl tested positive, they would have those giant yellow biohazard tapep across that unit door, like in the movies, and they would announce in the whatsapp group and alert everyone.\n2. clearly all public space, transportation is shut. City to city border will be blocked so no one is allowed to travel at all.\n3. For apartment building with multiple entrance point, all others except the main one will be sealed shut. There is at least one patrolman guarding each apartment. Anyone going in and out need to show their paper/permit on why they need to head out, **the reason for this to not only to contain the viruse, but also deter looting, stealing as all business are shut and left unguarded.**\n4. You basically can't drive unless it's for some serious grocery haul. Some apartment just shut their garage door during the entire lock-down.\n5. For any person taking a stroll randomly, or go on the street without permit, large fine, even arrest. If you run you get tazed ( bcs they think you might be out looting )\n6. For most cities the entrance to highway is blocked, you can't get out the city at all unless you walk the whole way, provided you don't get stop mid-way.\n7. For anyone that's suspected carrying the disease ( I.E leaving wuhan before the city shutdown ) they will track you down and everyone you been in contact with on your way, mandatory quarantine.\n8. And finally, people just take this incredibly seriously, family would not meet one another during the lock-down, it's not unusual for family member all staying at separate hotel rooms so they don't cross infect one another if one of their test come back positive.\n9. Clearly some of these are quite drastic, but just keep in mind, the mentality in the society is that people are in this together, not brewing rebellion. So even measures are kind of over-the-top, but the patrolman, police enforcing it, do it with genuine care for the community. Ppl have a strong belief that they can get out of these together and everyone is doing their part, this is important as i see some citizens' behavior in other countries' current lock-down can only be described as irresponsible\n\nFor treatment:\n\n1. They built a tons of make-shift containment center, so for anyone that's mildly sick, you get put in there and loaded up on antiviral drugs. one nurse can take care of up to 50 patients so it saves hospital beds for ppl who need more urgent care.\n2. They also built a couple hospitals but only in Wuhan as the city's healthcare system collapsed.\n3. Bcs rest of the country was not as heavily affected, there were something like 300K healthcare workers sent to Wuhan ( Hubei in general) later on to help out. that's 300K nurse and doctors, most went voluntarily, which is kind of nuts as that is more than the number of the patients, but then again, china quarantine anyone that's being suspected carrying the virus in those containment center, and most test end up negative. It's quite a feat none of those 300K are infected, 0. It helps they are all in full hazmat suit all the time. ( edit, by 0% i meant for the 300K sent to hubei when wuhan's own healthercare system collapsed, the doctors/nurses indigenous to wuhan seen 30% infection rate, and some hospital at the early stage would have their entire staff team infected bcs they are not wearing masks and etc, that was a big problem as more patients are coming in and fewer staff available, doctors were literally going non stop without sleep for full week ended up broken down, staffs are heavy on xanax, as hundreds of death pile up )\n4. and then clearly medical supplies were being made countrywide, in a couple wks they made billions of face masks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWuhan certainly didn't beat this epidemics by just its own resource, the entire china helped, and even to this point, whilst the rest of the country has started to restore economic activity bit by bit, wuhan is till under strict lock-down. No park or any sort of business is open. No public transportation, things will likely remain the same till early April.\n\nSo you could see what measures have been put in place and it start to make sense why the mortality and R0 is substantially higher in almost anywhere else. Now i have been living in north america for almost a decade and have lived in Europe and Australia before, the few challenges i see with implementing some of the measures in western countries are:\n\n1. ppl would likely not willing to share their travel history, and even if they do, travel history and contact history are private information thus wouldn't be openly shared with the neighborhood. So it's impossible to know if your neighborhood is safe or has the virus has been transmitting inside.\n2. **ppl would argue total lock-down is violation of their freedom, human rights and etc for its own merit so a true real Marshall law style lock-down is likely not on the table. China implement a very stringent lock-down so after one month they would see 0 new case and people can get back to their life. A half-ass lockdown wouldn't stop transmitting, it would just slow it, so it will take almost forever to see 0 new cases and that defeats the whole purpose of the lock down. If there is still active undetected cases out there then soon as ppl get back to their normal life the outbreak would worsen instantly. i don't know why this is hard to understand. You need a true 0 new cases for the lockdown to make sense. Anything less than that it's a waste of time and resource.**\n3. Media has been downplaying the danger, or just use China's number to model their projection but totally disregard the measures that were put in place\n4. Also important to know that the Chinese manage to identify every single person carrying the virus, even those one show very little symptoms, and the mortality rate is based on that.\n5. The mortality rate for flu is at 0.1% is because most of the cases are simply not detected, had you detect all the flu cases the real mortality rate is likely 1 in a hundred thousands or something like along that line. That's also the problem with much higher mortality rate in Italy, and soon in rest of EU plus US, which is there are not enough ppl being tested, if you are only testing the ones that are already in the hospital, then you are really just testing the 20% that are in a condition that need to be hospitalized ,and then of course the mortality rate among those group would be substantially higher. Remember for 100 person tested positive, 20 will need hospitalization, and 3 will need intensive care. **However what's happening right now is you are only testing that 20 person, so you will be looking at mortality rate of about 3/20 which would be around 15%, and i think we will likely see that as mortality rate in Italy keep climbing higher.**\n6. Finally, is that Wuhan has the entire china behind supporting it, which is world second largest economy with the largest manufacturing power and plenty of medical personnel reserve, countries like Italy don't have that support system, when things start to collapse they can't reply on backup for help. So the best is to be as prepared as possible bcs everyone got their hands full if your healthcare system collapse that's pretty much game over.\n\nThe sooner the world start to learn and realize this, the sooner we can have this thing under control. Good luck everyone and stay safe.",

What if this 3d printed valve fails prematurely or sheds plastics into the patient's lungs? These are questions left unanswered and may cause more harm than good.  \n\nI understand that these are uniquely difficult  times  for the healthcare industry, but I hope this business and hospital appreciates the brevity of the decision they've made to use an unapproved medical device. Again, I know this will be unpopular but there's a process meant to ensure people's health and safety. Sure there are probably places it could improve, and regulators need to adapt to these innovative technologies.

This is a rough translation I made (not authorized, but since the post is public I assume it is not a problem. All mistakes are mine. In case the tone sounds controversial, assume that it is my inability to properly translate the Italian expressions, since the post is made to straighten out the facts).\n\nYou can find the original post here:\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/Ing.Cristian.Fracassi/posts/10222339428782713](https://www.facebook.com/Ing.Cristian.Fracassi/posts/10222339428782713) \n\n==================\n\nLet me make a note, because the media attention that has been generated after the production of the respirator valves that we made with 3D printers is going further and further from the truth.\n\nFirst of all, it is true: we received a phone call, we have been told that in the Chiari hospital valves for respirators were missing and people were dying.\n\nThe ordinary way, getting the pieces from the supply chain, was not doable for a simple reason of missing time.\n\nWhat should have we done?\n\nDo you know in movies, when someone is going to fall into a ravine? Usually, in that moment the main character arrives and throw the person a rope, but that rope is almost broken...and time flies.\n\nI don't believe that in that moment one asks many questions if the rope is standard-compliant or if it belongs to someone else. In that moment you are thinking only about saving the falling person. Then, once safe, breathing heavily and with adrenaline going down, you can think.\n\nWe were in this situation. There were people risking their lives and we acted. Period.\n\nNow, with cold mind, let's think.\n\nFirst, do not call us heroes, as someone said. Sure, people were dying, but we just did our duty. To refuse would have not been vile, but homicide. Far from us.\n\nDo not call us, as someone did, geniuses. The genius is, maybe, Venturi, that discovered the physics principle that we just applied, like any other engineer would have done. There is no genius in the piece that everyone is talking about, only the application of a physics principle.\n\nBut now let us also put a stop to many words that are flying around beyond our intentions and our control: we have no intention of making money on this situation, we have no intention of using the designs or the product beyond the strictly necessary that forced us to act, we have no intention of releasing the design.\n\nNot only that: in this time when public opinion is extremely susceptible, please do not attack anyone.\n\nIf we acted fast is only because with 3D printers one can quickly make a small production that at industrial scale would not be possible.\n\nAnd finally, let us say that some numbers (about money) that we see going around are not true: we don't want to enter into the details, because the cost of the single piece is not that of the small amount of plastic used: one has to consider the time of professionals, materials, energy, etc...\n\nThe cost is something complicated, but let us keep it secret, and do not let the left hand what the right hand does.\n\nSimply, we would like that of this story remains only one thing: the community, made of a hospital, a newspaper, a team of professionals, did something against time pressure and saved some lives.\n\nThat's it.\n\nAll the other things - rights, certifications, costs and controversy - should shut up in front of the right to life. If you don't agree, do not ask us, but to the people that, thank God, are still breathing.\n\nThanks to everyone for your support. Many of you wrote me, more than 2000, I don't know that I can read everything and thank everyone.\n\nLet's focus on the true heroes, the one that save lives, that work 16-hours shifts at the hospitals and are night and day besides the sick one, and let's praise them.\n\nThanks.",

The connection among coronavirus and 3D printing isn't altogether clear, generally in light of the fact that we are a long way from understanding what the long, medium and even short terms ramifications of the pandemic will be on worldwide stock chains. \n\nAdded substance assembling might have the option to assume a job in assisting with supporting modern stock chains that are influenced by constraints on conventional creation and imports. One thing is without a doubt however: 3D printing can have a quick helpful impact when the production network is totally broken. That was, luckily, the situation when a Northern Italian medical clinic required a trade valve for a revival gadget and the provider had run out with no real way to get more in a brief timeframe. \n\nThe first valve (on the left) and its 3D printed twin. \n\nOne of the greatest prompt issues that coronavirus is causing is the monstrous number of individuals who require escalated care and oxygenation so as to live through the contamination long enough for their antibodies to battle it. This implies the best way to spare lives now – past avoidance – is to have whatever number working restoration machines as would be prudent. Also, when they separate, possibly 3D printing can help. \n\nMassimo Temporelli, the originator of The FabLab in Milan and an exceptionally dynamic and famous advertiser of Industry 4.0 and 3D imprinting in Italy, detailed from the get-go Friday thirteenth that he was reached by Nunzia Vallini, supervisor of the Giornale di Brescia, with whom he has been teaming up for quite a long while for the scattering of Industry 4.0 culture in schools. \n\nShe clarified that the medical clinic in Brescia (almost one of the hardest-hit districts for coronavirus contaminations) direly required valves (in the photograph) for an escalated care gadget and that the provider couldn't give them in a brief timeframe. Coming up short on the valves would have been emotional and a few people may have lost their lives. So she inquired as to whether it is conceivable to 3D print them \n\nAfter a few calls to fablabs and organizations in Milan and Brescia and afterward, luckily, an organization in the zone, Isinnova, reacted to this call for help through its Founder and CEO Cristian Fracassi, who brought a 3D printer legitimately to the emergency clinic and, in only a couple of hours, updated and afterward delivered the missing piece. \n\nOn the night of Saturday fourteenth (the following day) Massimo detailed that \"the framework works\". At the hour of composing, 10 patients are joined in breathing by a machine that utilizes a 3D printed valve. As the infection unavoidably keeps on spreading worldwide and breaks supply chains, 3D printers – through individuals' inventiveness and structure capacities – can loan some assistance. Or then again valve, or defensive apparatus, or veils, or anything you will require and can't get from your typical provider. \n\n After the main valves were 3D printed utilizing a fiber expulsion framework, on the spot at the emergency clinic, more valves were later 3D printed by another nearby firm, Lonati SpA, utilizing a polymer laser powder bed combination process (photograph underneath).",

Don't go to the birthday event, a bar, or to the gym.\n\n2) Netflix, YouTube Premium and certain movies should be on a large discount or free, so more people would stay home and not contract the infection.\n\n2) Order groceries and food online and let them bring to your door. Wait 30 minutes to 1 hour in order to avoid the possible contamination from a delivery person. Your milk or ham won't spoil.\n\n3) Increase payouts to food delivery personnel and encourage them at least to wear a mask and carry a hand sanitizer.\n\n4) Prohibit all public events for just 2-3 weeks.\n\n5) Asian countries wear masks. Look at China, the infection rate is going down. 99.9% of the Chinese people did not get infected and the country is recovering!\n\n6) Do not air travel or go on a cruise. Air circulation in the airplane pretty much guarantees you getting the virus.\n\n7) If you are sick and between 18-59 years old, SELF-quarantine yourself and isolate from everyone! \n\n8) If you are sick and your age is 60+ OR if you have underlying medical conditions, then go to the doctor. In this case, the best course of action would be to mobilize special ER service, in which the service arrives at your home with the special protective equipment. Going to the doctor by yourself will just infect more people while you travel.\n\n9) Don't panic and stay vigilant.\n\nMore to come, if you have suggestions comment here or inbox me.",

None left to buy. 7k procured. 30k more needed in next 14 days. Splitting ventilators to work for 2 people.\n* Hotels and dorms will be used for beds.\n* Retired staff being requested to return.\n*  **Fed Gov can use Defense Production Act to have manufacturers make this happen now. Inexplicable to him as to why feds are not doing this.**\n* **HHS has 20k ventilators. Gov Cuomo wants them now. Sec Alex Azar hasn't done this yet. Will take 2 weeks to get these into hospitals.** FEMA is sending 400 ventilators yet they want a pat on the back. They are missing the magnitude of the problem.\n* Experimental treatments are being explored. May be testing at some point for people with antibodies to the virus. And plasma treatment with antibodies. Or at least let workers return to work sooner if they have the antibodies.\n* After NY gets through apex send equipment and people to next location that needs them.\n* Goal for economy is to have a smarter approach. No longer isolate everyone. Let recovered and younger, healthy return to work. We can work on public health and economy by being smarter.\n* Lives over economy first.\n\nEdit: Summary of this video. https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1242476864586706946 Weird.

With that said why is it not a requirement for retail workers to be required to wear a face mask? My girlfriend works at petco where it has been SLAMMED lately, and not only could she easily get it from someone but she could very easily spread it to every person she comes into contact with. We have fabric face masks so wouldn't it make sense to wear one and wash it every day? CDC says to only wear it if you have symptoms and that wearing a facemask will absorb moisture or 'make it worse'.  I'm seeing so many contradictory statements I just don't know who or what to believe anymore. Like, we wouldn't have a shortage in face masks if they \"Made it worse\" so why are doctors and nurses exempt to their own statements? Thoughts? I know it isn't 100% fool proof but surely it's better than going unprotected and potentially infecting more people.",

Story time:\n\nSo, Starbucks has a policy that not a lot of people know about: if you order a drink, and you sit in the cafe, you can get free refills of *coffee or tea* for as long as you’re in the cafe. Doesn’t matter if you got a Frappuccino or a Venti mocha. You get free refills of coffee and tea. \n\nNow, understandably, this policy does NOT apply to drive thru customers. For one, we don’t know when you got that cup. If you bought a smoothie a week ago and you’re trying to refill your cup with free coffee, c’mon. Right? Get outta here with that bullshit. \n\nSo anyway, I’m a barista and I’m taking orders in the drive thru, and a customer I’ve never met in my life rolls up to the speaker. He says he wants a free coffee. I told him the policy, we argued over the speaker, and then he asked to talk to my supervisor. I told him that my supervisor was gonna tell him the same thing that I’m saying. WHICH IS CORPORATE FUCKING POLICY! \n\nHe comes inside, talks to my supervisor, my supervisor tells him what’s up, and sends him on his merry way. But here’s the best part: the fucking guy called corporate and they gave him a $50 GIFT CARD! Our regional manager talked to us and said he doesn’t want corporate on his ass about little stuff like this, so next time, just give the guy some coffee. My supervisor and I were basically reprimanded for enforcing corporate policy. That’s the day I realized that Starbucks doesn’t give a fuck about it’s employees. They’re just a means for taking money from its customers. Once they can find robots to make coffee and accept money, they’ll do it in a heartbeat. \n\n**TLDR:** My supervisor and I tried to enforce a corporate policy and got yelled at by our regional manager because the customer is always right.",

I am not impressed by their constant rhetoric of caring about their customers, partners, and communities. I sent corporate a tactful but firm request via email to shut down the stores. This, in my opinion, would be “walking the talk” since having drive through open requires human contact and thus spreads the virus. The reply I received was that Starbucks is staying up to date on progress of the virus and is doing everything they can to insure safety. On this, I call BS. Baristas are being exposed to this virus out of fear of losing their jobs. Starbucks is encouraging (at my store anyway) customer connection regardless of the extremely contagious spread of this virus - even going so far as to ask me “why are you not talking to the customer in the window?” They are still more worried about the customer connection score received when Starbucks Rewards members fill out the one question survey asking if their barista got to know them today. A multi-billion dollar company has no excuse not to close and compensate their partners accordingly. At one point, I thought Starbucks was a great company to work for. They have fantastic benefits and regularly come out with new perks. All this being said, if you have the time today, please contact the corporate office and express your concern. Starbucks cares more about profit than the health of their customers and employees. If anything, please do me a favor, and boycott Starbucks. This is the only way to show your support of the baristas who make your favorite drink each day. I’ve considered trying to start a #BoycottStarbucks” twitter hashtag in hopes of making more people aware, especially if the hashtag started trending, but I do not have a following on Twitter. \n\nIn all, thank you for your support. We are as scared as the rest of the world, but have not received the crucial and absolute action necessary to keep us safe, as so many other companies have done. Please spread this message, and feel free to message me with any further questions. \n\nSincerely,\nA barista who DOES care about the wellbeing of customers, partners, and communities.",

His thigh muscle like got pulled up towards his hip. He had surgery on it. 2 days after surgery, he falls trying to get dressed and he breaks the ball off his femur on the other leg. He had a second operation, emergency hip replacement 3 days after his first surgery. A year later he was already back at the Y every morning, swimming. They're old and at risk, but they have truly taken care of themselves. I really admire that. They're in the best health they can be. They've done everything they can.",

To give you some background information yesterday the LCME announced that all medical schools were to suspend 3rd and 4th year rotations. While this puts a delay on our graduation and is not the biggest problem right now by far understand that all graduating medical students will start residency in July 1st of each year. This means that not only is our education coming to a screeching halt, but those of us who are set to graduate next year will likely not be able to start work July 1st of 2021, leading to a shortage of about 20,000+ newly graduated doctors across the nation in a country that is already short staffed. I only bring this up as Italy has decided to circumvent this by graduating medical students who have completed all required core clerkships early to start them working fast.

As an awkward computer nerd kid, you've been something of a role model for me for a good chunk of my life, ever since I got mocked mercilessly for doing a biography report on you in sixth grade (my classmates thought it funny I didn't pick an athlete). Thank you for all that you've done, in the world, in your life. \n\nI don't know if this is a question you can speak to, but it's one I've been trying to find for a while now:\n\nRight now, we have data regarding the distribution of mild vs severe vs critical cases. We also have data regarding the fatality rate _by age bracket_. But I haven't seen, as far as I can tell, any data concerning the distribution if mild/severe/critical cases by age group. \n\nAs a 30 year old, moderately healthy man, this is of significant concern to me. The existing fatality statistics suggest that me and my friends should be safe, but I am keenly aware that this rests on the assumption of getting appropriate medical care. Given the exponential growth of this disease, I don't think assuming the availability of medical care is reasonable for the typical infected person, say, 3 months down the line. \n\nWe have heard a lot of authorities, political leaders, etc., state that the risk to young people is low. However, that could mean two very different things. The fatality rate might be lower because young people generally have milder disease overall. Or the fatality rate might be lower because young people have severe disease just as frequently, but better tolerate the treatment in hospital. If I knew that the first hypothesis was correct, it would go a long way towards reducing my anxiety. If, instead, I knew that the second hypothesis was correct, it would inform my personal decisionmaking regarding emergency preparedness and plans. \n\nThe stories I am hearing from European medical workers, commenting on how many young people get sick, are concerning. But in the absence of data, they are just anecdotes, and I don't know how to evaluate them. So my question to you is: _**are you aware of any published data showing the distribution of mild versus severe cases, broken down by age bracket?**_\n\nThank you again for your time.",

Some pharma companies are already investigating IL-6, but those drugs are not available in all countries yet, nor cost-effective, nor does regulatory approval and cohort studies in one jurisdiction mean its available in another. In my mind rheumatologists everywhere could do their own cohort studies on both TNF-a and IL-6 biologics.\n\nThe sooner they do the more lives will be saved.

Her dumping of stock and the purchase of stock in a company that sells work from home software is particularly troubling. She pleads ignorance on Twitter, but her husband is the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. I find it extremely suspicious when Loeffler says she didn't even know that stock got dumped at the perfect time. Net worth of a half billion and she has no say when her broker blindly sells 1.5 million dollars in stock from companies that would tank during a pandemic? Bullshit. \n\nThey all have the right to a fair trial should the Ethics Committee recommend prosecution.   My only question is if all their hearings on COVID-19 were open or closed to the public. I see a possible defense if the meetings were 100% open to the public.  If you were reasonably paying attention to the news, you would have seen the possible disaster looming if COVID-19 wasn't contained to one area in China.\n\nNow, if they got closed door information,  I don't see a defense. If there isn't enough evidence to recommend charges, I hope the Senate censors all of them. \n\nWith Loeffler and her husband, they have a net worth of half a billion dollars.  The greed always amazes me. They could have taken the hit on the stocks they sold,  may have lost six figures.  I could see the purchase of the stock in the teleconference software being far easier to defend than the selling of the 1.5 million in stock.  But damn, how much is enough?\n\n\n It makes one wonder how they accumulated the wealth they have. Insider trading is harder to detect. If some big investment firm has an algorithm scanning the internet for key words, or if they get the information  (like a company going bankrupt) a split second before anyone else, they can execute their trade before anyone has a chance to finish reading the title of the news story.  That is very hard to detect directly.  I'm being generous with getting the news a second before anyone else.  They could get it milliseconds before everyone else and execute their trades.  When Delta had their flash crash when an old story on Delta's bankruptcy decades ago hit the internet, I couldn't even log in to my brokerage account website.   \n\nLoeffler's history is sketchy from the start. Look at her and her husband and tell me why she married ber husband. \n\nAt a minimum,  the Republicans need to run someone else for Loeffler's current seat (she was appointed by the governor).",

I'm using toilet paper as an example, but this applies to any high-demand good.\n\nI ask because I'm genuinely not certain.  My assumption would be that if TP cost 2x as much, there would be more in stores right now.  In that case, some poor people would be able to scrape together enough money to buy TP, and some wouldn't and would be stuck without any and with no way to get some since their checks haven't arrived yet.  At the current price level, some poor people would be able to find some while shopping, but they would have to spend more time traveling to different stores to do so, increasing the risk of spreading the virus, and they would definitely be able to afford it when they found some.  Those who weren't able to find any would be stuck without any and with no way to get some.  I don't know if the number who would have to go without would be higher in the high-price case or in the low-stock case.\n\nCompanies will choose the path that gives them the most money regardless of which is actually better for poor people, no questions there.  The problem is that I'm not certain which path actually helps poor people more.  \n\nTo me, from a what-should-the-regulations-be standpoint, the dilemma sounds a lot like what NY governor Cuomo said about choosing between people's lives and their livelihoods; if prices are high and in stock they can't afford to buy anything, and if prices are low and sometimes out of stock they have to go to multiple stores and spread the virus, and some can't buy any and end up with none, the same as in the high-price case.",

We have the memes and jokes because it's how we're dealing with the situation. For all your crap about how sensitive the new generations are, you're the first to complain the second you're the butt of a joke. Yeah it's dark humor, and yours was racist, homophobic, and a laundry list of other shit, you don't have some moral high ground. If it was a joke when you said your insensitive shit, they're jokes now. Humor doesn't stop when you're offended.\n\n2. We have grandparents and parents, and other loved ones too, the memes aren't a genuine wish for older people to die, it's a reply to the reaction older generations had to things that will impact us in our lifetime, i.e. climate change, our awful middle income economies and their complete lack of a fuck, especially being the generation responsible, for causing these issues.\n\n3. Not fair to put everyone in your generation in the same boat? Then how about you use the same logic and not look at a viral clip of some Florida asshole that the media picked up specifically knowing it'll get views and thinking it represents my entire broad demographic?\n\n4. Gen x had the worst of them? I hope you're kidding. Do you own your home? Own a car? Have an income and career you feel safe in? Everyone in your circles the same? We're the generation that feels like a 1%er if we get those by our 30s. You didn't get the worst of the economy or the worst of boomers, just like you're not getting the jokes. \n\nGet off your pedestal, and either take a joke or move on with your life.",

Our hospital will be repurposing some healthcare workers and other vetted/tested community members to be delivery drivers. Essentially, each user account associated with an address will be able to request meals and/or supplies, and the app will generate deliveries based on the available supplies offered in donation. The donations will come from local food banks, restaurants, and individuals. \n\nI wanted to see if you could publicize this, I would love to share this app with other communities around the world. I believe this app will serve three vital functions 1) provide food and services to those in need without increasing risk of spreading the infection 2) increase camaraderie and lift the general spirit of the community 3) able to be reused in future crises, and perhaps even in every day life for those in need but unable to travel \n\nFeel free to reach out to me via DM for more information or if you wish to aid in the development of the app.\n\nEDIT: FYI this app will be fully open source and free.

Walmart accepted it but the sad part was the meat that was returned had to be thrown away.

Bought a batch of rice and found maggots inside? Sorry, no return. Bought Lysol with a faulty spray cap? Sorry, no return.\n\nI understand the anti-hoarder sentiment, but it's disturbing that a company *retroactively* (aka after-the-fact) changes a customer purchase agreement, rather than only enforcing it for customers who made purchases *after* the policy change.\n\nMaybe Costco is targeting scummy people who bulk buy planning to resell merchandise. Costco's existing controls handle that. If you buy 2 of a controlled item, then leave the store and come back the same day to buy 2 more, reportedly your purchase is stopped and your membership access is frozen for 24 hours. Costco could easily extend this buying limit to more days or whatever it wants to manage the situation.  Or it could limit returns to 2 of a controlled item. If you bought 20 palettes of cleansing wipes back in February, sorry, you can only return 2. That would be reasonable, and funny.",

It has constantly decreased from 50 Million to \\~50k. I guess mostly due to better healthcare and better information sharing/dispersal mechanisms. But this is not the time to get complacent! We all have to do everything in our control to avoid this.

News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often.

Honestly, part of me wants to just hurry up and get it so I can build up antibodies. \n\nIronically, the only thing that concerns me is people's absolute insane reaction to this situation. People are acting like society is crumbling around us. Democrats are using it as a political tool to roast the Trump administration. If they really believe Covid-19 is a bad as the media makes it seem, they should be coming together in solidarity to help constructively solve the problem, not using it as a tool for political gain. This kind of behavior is exactly what I would expect from Trump, but I hold the Democrats to a higher standard.",

She’s trying to get through until the hotel shuts down, but I doubt that will happen any time soon. They don’t get anything aside from gloves. I’ve been desperate to find masks for her but I can’t find any. It’s more scary because she is deemed essential, but the pay doesn’t allow for her to be able to set money aside for emergency funds. Lots of people think that these essential workers are paid well, and without a union, my mom would be making $13/h like when she was when she got hired without a union, not really something you can survive off of in the tej-state area.

The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality.  The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. \n\nIf you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.\n\nI can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”\n\nThere are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.  \n\nWhen Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse. \n\nWhy? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? \n\nOn Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse. \n\nThere are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?\n\nAnd finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment. \n\nYou have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time. \n\nAnd for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago. \n\nSoon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now. \n\nPlease share.",

This is another fact, one day this cycle will repeat itself, most likely it will be a virus we never heard of or never even contemplated. So once this is over what can you do to protect yourself in the future? Here is one mans advice, take it or leave it, it's up to you. For a large part of the population there is something that we buy on a regular basis that is not a necessity. That latte in the morning, that lunch out during the week, that extra piece of clothing we wear only a few times, that creature comfort upgrade in the car we buy. Identify whatever it is, how much it costs and then stop buying it and start putting that money away. I used to be like just about everyone else, my thinking was so long as I was getting a paycheck I could afford things, then about 8 years ago I decided to try and save over and above what I was saving for retirement. Just a few bucks here and there nothing life changing. After a period of time I came to realize that I had enough that missing a week of work would not really effect me. I liked that feeling so I took a second look at my spending and found ways to save a few more bucks, a few less ballgames or maybe not buying the best tickets, a few less movies, holding on to my phone for an extra year or two before upgrading. Before too long I found I could miss two weeks of paychecks, then a month, then two months. Then I hit pay dirt when I realized that if push came to shove I could tell any boss to fuck off so long as I could find a job within 6 months, which then became a year. You get the picture. It has been liberating to my soul and really has taken a great deal of pressure from my life which really has become the payoff. I am not saying this is easy, especially at first. I am not saying everyone can expect the same results, but if in a year or two's time you can get to a place where missing 4 weeks of paychecks will not ruin you trust me you will be living a better life and your chances of coming out of the next pandemic unscathed will be exponentially better.",

If most people followed this, we could minimize the impact on the economy and maximize our ability to stop this virus. We don't have to shut things down entirely.

Yes, some people will still need to go to work because they can't work remotely - but we can make work for THEM safer if those of us who CAN stay the fuck home. \n\nAnd please can we stop with the unnecessary travel? I am so tired of hearing about people who are like \"Virus be damned! I am going to keep my pleasure vacation to \\[NAME ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD\\] even though it's completely unnecessary!\" Let's save the travel spaces for those who absolutely have to travel - people who are going to see dying or sick relatives, people who have to travel because it's essential to their job, etc. Your completely unnecessary vacation to the beach or Cancun or whatever is NOT necessary and is just making this situation worse. \n\nAnd can people PLEASE stay the fuck off cruise ships while they're at it? \n\nBottom line is there's a lot many of us can do to help slow down the spread of this virus, steps we can take without the government forcing our hand. \n\nI am really proud of my employer right now. They are telling everyone who can and wants to telework to do so. They have canceled all travel that isn't absolutely essential (most of our travel is pretty non-essential or can wait until a later date). They are telling us to avoid meeting in groups and to use the videoconferencing capabilities we already have. They aren't forcing people to stay home, but they are making it very easy to do so.

Even if it's helping out with every day amenities like gas or having money to buy some milk and bread (if you can find it in stores), every little bit helps.\n\nI will be the first person to tell you that Illinois is a fucked up state, but these measures are coming from a logical place and I will support my breathren.  \n\nPlease DM me if you are in dire need of assistance and I will do what I can.\n\nWe'll get through this. <3",

I've been followed out to my car with my own groceries by people demanding to know if we are \"hiding the real stuff for ourselves\".\n\nAnd the worst, the absolute WORST, is watching elderly customers come in by themselves, usually with canes or walkers, hobbling through the store looking for things like hand sanitizers that we've been sold out of for weeks. Younger, faster adults are ripping everything off the shelves as fast as we can stock, the most vulnerable people have no chance.\n\nI don't have any answers about the supply chain, I don't know which groceries you should be getting for your families, I don't know what cough syrup you should be choosing.

We have one choice - continue working despite all risks to ourselves, with our bosses doing jack fucking shit to protect us, or quit and be homeless in two months or less.\n\nOur bosses are doing nothing substantial to help us, because the only thing they *can* do is close, and that doesn't let us make our bosses' money for them. Hand sanitizer and wipes? Don't make me fucking laugh, I'm practically rubbing cheeks with people as a required function of my job. I'm close enough to smell your breath when you check out, and my management is pretending that fucking hand sanitizer is gonna do anything for me.\n\nWhile I'm sure there are good ones, every retail boss I've had has been a petty, greedy, sycophantic fuckhead who cares about their Christmas bonus and sucking up to their corporate daddies over any legitimate problem their employees have. They push you to work your fingers to the bone for pennies and gaslight, intimidate, and threaten you into doing whatever they want because they *know* they've got you over a financial barrel always, and they know that *you* know your options - snap to or fuck off so someone equally worthless to them can step up and do your job.\n\nThere's never any short supply of people like us, because it doesn't quite require a doctorate to stock shelves or run a cash register, and our bosses know it - if we get sick, they pretend to care for PR brownie points just long enough to get us back to work, and then the store's hours are mysteriously cut so there's no room for you, or you're laid off for some other reason, or your boss drops not-so-subtle hints about \"looking around for something else,\" or any of the other asinine things retail bosses do to get defective employees out of the way so they can hire someone they haven't broken in yet. Or maybe your wages take a little hit here and there over time until you're two dollars down from what you were at last year - and wow, it's weird that all these cuts started happening right after this whole coronavirus thing hit, huh? Well, at least we got paid sick leave for two fucking weeks out of the months this thing has been raging for!\n\nI promise you, anyone you see with a retail uniform on doesn't want to be there even slightly and is praying that you aren't sick just as hard as you are. If we catch it, our options are 1) stay home, get fired, get really fucking sick, and shackle ourselves with medical debt it'll take years to pay off, or 2) keep working, knowing we're infecting everyone we see. Our bosses are all pretending that nothing's wrong and everything's being overblown... and the instant an employee tests positive, they'll shit a fucking brick trying to make sure that no customer can claim they were infected at that store for liability's sake. Nowhere - and I mean fucking NOWHERE - does the actual employee's health enter into these assholes' cognition anywhere. To them we're fucking chimpanzees they can teach to run a cash register.\n\nI understand the sentiment - thank you for recognizing that we're all at serious risk. But I didn't sign up to be exposed to a fucking pandemic for $10/hr, I signed up to run a cash register and collect a shitty-ass paycheck.",

Disinfectant wipes dispensers were ubiquitous (as were wastebins to toss them in), the checkin desks were numerous and positioned well away from one another, as were the voting kiosks - spaced 15 or so feet apart, each with disinfectant hand wipes box on the desk.  They made the place as safe as it could be, given its function as the engine room of our democracy.\n\nThe pollwokers, who wore gloves, were obviously keenly aware of the risks of contact with voters coming in to cast their ballots, yet they all cheerfully and efficiently did their jobs, which was to make it possible for people like me in their community to exercise their right to vote.  I couldn’t help but feel a swell of thanks to these people, so after I voted I said something and thanked them.\n\nIn my next rant, I will sing praises for health workers and caregivers, bona fide heroes to all in the crisis to come, and to whom we will owe a large debt of gratitude indeed.",

People should only leave the house for work that could not be postponed, to buy necessary food supplies and to help others [...].\n\nThis is absolutely huge — banning gatherings of over five people in one of the most democratic countries on earth.

Also yesterday (I think it was yesterday, I just saw the video today) the director of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, had to be spoken to like a child before he agreed to free coronavirus testing for all Americans, regardless of insurance. He had to be emasculated and humiliated in order to DO HIS JOB and protect the people from diseases and viruses like COVID-19. Personally, I have little faith left in the CDC and it seems clear to me that their main focus is revenue and profits. They don't care if the whole country gets sick so long as they continue to make money from it.\n\nI urge everybody who is even experiencing the slightest of flu-like symptoms to call their local doctors, clinics, hospitals, health lines, whatever resources are available to you. Call them and see what the next step is for coronavirus testing. Follow their instructions and do what you can to prevent the spread of the virus.",

Asian can't understand.\n\nEdit: The logic here is: As long as it helps (even for 1%) and as long as you can get one, Asian wear it. Also, mask is super common on streets every day. So, It's not weird to wear it right now.\n\n\nEdit edit: as the discussion continues here's some update. \n\n[Masks in Korea.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/International/south-korea-takes-measures-face-masks-domestically-amid/story%3fid=69254114) They are producing 10 million masks per day.

People that post ridiculous pricing don't sell many as everybody can see the market rate.\n\n  I do think if the government put in price controls, it would just make things worse.

I had the symptoms and recent travel history and confirmation from two separate doctors agreeing I need to be tested. There was nothing they could do when the CDC said no.\n\nTheir reasoning was I am not in a vulnerable age group (25M no prior illness) so I should be fine, they will only test me if I was severe enough to the point of hospitalization. They threw my samples out and sent me home. Shitty thing is my symptoms went away over the weekend but today (11 days after getting back to the states) my fever is back. So I don’t know if I’m getting better or worse and I have no way to be tested at the moment.\n\nMy two weeks in quarantine is about to be over but now with the fever back, I don’t know how much longer I should be quarantined.

So in places without universal testing (most western nations), only 10-20% of infected get sick enough to go to the hospital where they might be tested. \n\nThat 10-20% translates to 5-10x the number of tested cases that are walking around not seeking medical care.\n\nBut in the US especially, a lot of folks who are showing up in hospitals are NOT BEING TESTED. \n\nHow much does that increase the 5-10x? Who knows.\n\nIf we assume only half the people that should be tested actually ARE being tested (that might be significantly overestimating the testing in the US!), then that means that for every confirmed case there are 10-20 more that are walking around feeling okay, but spreading it.\n\n**The Number of Confirmed Cases Indicates Infection Numbers from Weeks Ago**\n\nWith the incubation period and the length of time before people get sick enough to go to the hospital, we know most who test positive (in the nations without universal testing) actually caught the virus 2-3 weeks before.\n\nThey get infected, there's a week incubation, maybe they start to feel a scratchy nose like they're coming down with a cold, they get a fever, they don't get better, they go to the hospital, they get tested, then two days later the results show 1 additional confirmed case. But they were infected 2-3 weeks ago.\n\nItaly has implemented massive lockdowns of affected region two weeks ago, and they are still not seeing a slowing of infection rates. Because they got infected before the lockdown.\n\n**Exponential Growth is Unfathomable for Most Humans**\n\nThe US has about 1750 confirmed cases as of March 12.\n\nIf you make a conservative estimate and assume there are only 10 infections for every confirmed case, that means the infected rate would be 17,500 infected at the same time as the 1750 confirmed cases.\n\nNow if you assume 17,500 were infected only two weeks ago, and you assume 20% growth PER DAY (which is about what we've seen in western nations and below the 24-40% growth we've seen in the US), then you would expect to have about 225,000 infected Americans right now.\n\n**That's a low estimate. 225,000 infected with 1,750 confirmed cases.**\n\nAnd on March 13 with that fairly low 20% day over day growth, we'd expect that to be 270,000.\n\n* March 14: 325,000\n* March 15: 390,000\n* March 16: 465,000\n* March 17: 560,000\n\nYou can see how nuts exponential 20% growth per day is.\n\nIf you take even just 25% per day growth (which we've seen just about everywhere), but still figure only a fairly fast 2-week delay between infection and confirmation, that 225,000 number balloons to 400,000 infected with 1,750 cases.\n\nIf you figure a 3-week delay... 1.9 million infected for 1,750 confirmed cases.\n\nRewind a bit and let's assume there weren't just 10 infections per confirmed case, but 20 (due to lack of testing in the US). That means that all those estimated infections would be double. 550,000 low estimate, 800,000 medium estimate, and a high (but not unreasonable) estimate of 3.8 million infected for 1,750 confirmed cases.\n\nThis is real, folks.\n\nEdit: I've updated the figures above with more accurate 10-20% hospitalization rate and a more reasonable low estimated 20% day over day growth.",

I was deeply saddened to hear Asian Americans (I assume from all countries as my fellow American is on average pretty racist/ ignorant apparently) that they were buying guns for protection from other Americans due to Covid-19 attacks.(I didn't hear of any attacks but the one guy that got beat up) \n\nNot trying to veer into politics so forgive me if I crossed that line but we need to be encouraging of all countries to be honest about their responses to this so that we can learn. The good the bad and the ugly. 1918 SF had a lot of things we can draw from but it was a different world then and almost impossible to think of all the ways those differences affect(effect?) Current global economy, goods transfer both physical and digital(since wfh is being ramped up) even education and resource allocation. Hell even the population density/locations have changed in big ways in some cases. Say Detroit vs Seattle (assuming that back in the day Seattle was not quite so packed I'm only mid 30's so I don't really remember very far). This data matters and yeah we got shit data to start but if I remember correctly the Chinese people are very proud and it shows in the govie. Japan is much the same. Here in America we are shocked at Japanese officials apologizing for late trains..Money is a big motivator but it's not the only one so let's capitalize on the opportunity to improve the world for everyone. \n\nNo I don't expect China to stop the awful stuff but how much can we really bad mouth them with the shit American govie does to not only our own but others.....our track record isn't clear and I think we should clean our own house while we are busy pointing fingers elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear this isn't a demo vs repub thing or a pro/anti (fill-in the blank president) this is learning to look past country flaws and see humans as humans and not enemies.",

They also announced that they will pay everyone regardless of whether they can work from home, and they're also giving a stipend to buy equipment to work from home. They need more employees now than before, it's in their interest to make sure people can work. \n\nMy point...it's nice that companies like mine and Sony are in a position to do this. But don't fault companies that are seeing revenue drop to zero for not doing something similar.",

The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence Sergio Romagnani writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of Vo 'Euganeo where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.\n\nThe immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo 'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".\n\nFor Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo 'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".\n\nIn Vo '- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.",

We shouldn’t cater to the lowest common denominator. This virus is not the common cold. Don’t treat it like it is. \n\nWe are told that we should adhere to ‘droplets precautions’; so we should treat this virus like it is the common cold or a stomach bug. As a result, N-95 masks and face -shields are locked away. Patients can be assessed in a group room with separating fabric curtains because apparently the virus hits the curtains and falls to the ground. Admitted patients  with symptoms have their room doors kept open to the ward because ‘droplet precautions only’.\n\nI’m not fabricating this. \n\nI see thousands of front-line  workers entering into a battle where they can only access regular surgical masks unless ‘intubation/ bi-PAP, bronchoscope’ .\n\nSo, hurray for Tom and Rita!\n\nLet’s use this sub to actually save lives",

There are a lot of things Italy should do and be able to do if they want to save themselves. The problem in Italy for now is not the massive deaths. That is not what people could do. The problem is there are still a large num of infectors wandering around the city. Based on the age distribution of Italy cases, probably there are at least 20K or most cases unconfirmed. \n\n1. Build temporary hospitals with stadiums as many as possible. One stadium can hold 300-500 infectors with mild symptoms but only need tens of nurses. It is not easy, but easier than other ways. Italy cannot let the virus spread any more. **DO NOT let them stay at home with others.** \n2. Do as many tests as possible. Italy has done tests aggressively, but it is still far from enough. If they cannot do PCR test, use clinical diagnosis. It’s better to be wrong than missing cases for now. Find all possible potential infectors to do the tests and isolate them in the temporary hospitals or whatever buildings they are. The isolation is essential.\n3. For citizens, avoid all unnecessary going outs and contact with others. Store food at home. The government should suspend all non-essential working. If the community leaders/volunteers can do the massive shopping and then delivery, that will be great. The community leader needs to stand out and restricts the communities.\n4. If you have to go out for supplies, wear masks, be quick, wash hands when you are back. The supermarket should measure temperatures frequently. For other activities, stay home, using internet to connect people rather than in person.\n\nOther two things to add\n\n1. All people in Italy should involve. This is the top thing in Italy right now. We have seen videos showing the lockdown is not as strict as we thought. Be an adult. You will not be exempted when your city is fallen. You and your families will be at high risk at that time. Things will not be fine without efforts. There is no point saying Wuhan-style lockdown is impossible in Italy. What if it is the only solution? Korean? Man, it is Mar 20, not Feb 20.\n\n2. There is no meaning to argue whether China’s num is underreported or not. The fact is they have things in control, but Italy doesn’t. Sticking to it doesn’t make you smart. I know my city will also experience the same thing soon. But I have to say, if we are still blaming others like cowards, we don’t deserve to be saved. We have been escaping our responsibility for weeks. And hope doesn’t come from words.",

We are doing about the same as Italy was doing several weeks ago.  “It’s like a bomb went off” was what the head of ICU said in Italy 3 days ago.  \n\nFear mongering?  I guess that’s the way you would see this if my comments were the only ones you were consuming.  Boy, you really need to read more.  Clearly you have not been reading scientific literature and publications on this.  Because if you did, you’d be hiding in your house.  \n\nWatch the videos on Wuhan.  See what the Chinese did.  They welded the doors shut on people to lock them in.  Social distancing is the only way we have to stop a virus from spreading.  We are not going to do that here.  Cause “freedom”. \n\nLook at the videos.  Go to reputable YouTube sites hosted my medical professionals and HC mathematicians.   John Campbell, MedCram. Once you comprehend the exponential math involved in viral spreading, maybe you will understand.  \n\nHere. Read this:  https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\n\nDid you read it?  Take about 30 minutes.   \n\nNaw.   You prefer to say Fear Mongering.\n\nFear mongering sounds so dismissive.  But if my post scares you then good.  I hope someone reading this will figure out that they need to alter their behaviors and stop spreading this.   You might be fine, but you can still spread this to someone who will die as a result.  And it’s not like the flu.   \n\nRead the medical literature on this.  I have.  My siblings are all doctors.   I rely on their advise and comments.  Estimates out of Germany are that 70% of Germany will get this.  Harvard epidemiologists have estimated 20-70% of Americans will get this.  It was originally 40-70% but...politics and fear mongering accusations forced them to adjust down.   Then Harvard shut down and started converting their facilities to temporary hospitals.   \n\nRead that again.  Harvard, a bunch of fear mongering stupid people, a concerting their facilities to temporary hospital facilities because hey....fear mongering.  BTW - I graduated from Harvard , 2012. HBS. And I have a degree in advanced mathematics, UW 1987. But according to you - I’m fear mongering.  Cause math is unreliable.  And it only applies when it’s convenient- like interest rate calculations.  But not viral spreading.  \n\nWe should be building hospitals right now.  In 2-6 weeks you will witness something that you have never seen before.   I understand.  You don’t believe the math.  You don’t get R-naught.  You can’t see how every 5-6 days the population infected will double.   You can’t even imagine that 14 days quarantine is necessary.  Meanwhile the Chinese are saying viral shedding is 25 days and the University of Nebraska has a patient shedding at 36 days.\n\nI get it.  Fear mongering is how you see this. \n\nBut in 2 weeks- you should call me out again.  And if I’m wrong I will gladly admit it and apologize for asking you to read scientific literature and believing in science and mathematical modeling.  And in 2 months, I will lick a subway door handle if I’m wrong.  \n\nBut I’m not. \n\nMath.   Whip out a calculator and run some numbers.   \n\nAnd BTW - I’m not afraid.  I started preparing weeks ago.  When all the male doctors started to shave their beards.  And when they started to order n95 masks and PPEs.  And when I got calls to find suppliers and discovered they were all out.  That’s when I started to prepare.  I’m not a prepper.   But I did prepare.  And I had to convince my wife of this.  We pulled our little kids from school late last week.  As of today, all their schools are closed.   You know what the school said to us on Monday?   “You are over reacting”.  Really?   Then why are you closed 5 days later?  \n\nFear mongering.  \n\nYou you who saves me Bruh?   Ignorant cocky people who think math is bullshit.   \n\nGood luck.",

I had to travel two counties away just to get a flu test, because i, for some reason, took the advice of local doctors, who are being directed by the county- that if you have the flu you can't get the virus.  We were very excited when my flu test came back positive.  That changed when my fiance's and daughter's came back negative (they were given a more accurate test) when we all exhibit the same symptoms- all of them, but mine are much worse.  The current situation- clinics refuse to let me in the buildings, hospitals ask we leave, local doctors cannot take me as a new patient and ask i leave.  The county only communicates via scripted news statements saying how well they are doing, and joking that their office now has therapy dogs so they can feel better (presumably ignoring calls and spreading misinformation while patting yourself on the back is stressful).

We got more in recently, and are almost out again due to the backlog.\n\nYesterday the public health lab stopped recommending that we screen for everything else, and they also green lit the use of our rapid flu swabs for covid testing. Unfortunately, in the past week we've nearly exhausted our supply of those and they are back ordered.\n\nWe were told yesterday from management that they had good news, due to our lack of supplies, we'll likely see a reduction in our workload since we are soon going to be unable to perform covid testing. Despite being severely overworked, with most of our staff now faced with child care issues since all the schools are closed, this was not seen as good news by anyone in the lab.\n\nThe requirements now for our hospital to perform covid testing is basically \"you need to be really sick and in a high risk group\" or admitted to the hospital. We offered drive through testing for 2 days.\n\nIt's embarrassing. We've exhausted our supplies for flu and rsv testing unnecessarily, and now we lack the ability to test our community for covid. \n\nI guess if you can't test, you can't get any confirmed cases..

The lab world is highly regulated by multiple different agencies and regulations all at the same time. CLIA, CMS, FDA, ASCP, CLSI etc etc. The FDA was most likely the main problem as they have to approve every test that gets run. The clinical labs could have had 1mil tests, but if the FDA hasn't approved them, you cannot run them or your lab can get shut down. I also think the administration, along with many others downplayed the seriousness of this to avoid a country wide panic. As such, large decisions were probably delayed. Such as... do we spend 10 million developing these 2 million test kits when only a couple thousand may get sick? Companies are very risk averse, and it all comes down to money over lives.\n\nEdit: Some folks were saying there counties told them tests aren't available. That may be the case. I think the administration prioritized distribution to areas that are highly impacted such as NY. Also, the large reference labs, Quest and LabCorp, should have them. This would have to be a send out test though, and depending on your local hospital policies, they may or may not be set as an approved vendor. I have seen this pop up for tests not related to Covid. The clinic gets a sample that needs a certain test. The in-house lab isn't certified to do it, so that have to send it out. A quest lab might be next door, but if they aren't approved by the company, they can't send it to them. Red tape.\n\nI will say, in a non-pandemic situation, this a good way to do things. You have to make sure your employees know what they are doing, and you have to be able to trust the results of the tests you are running. The red tape helps make that happen. However, in this situation when stuff needs to happen very quickly, it cannot go quickly unless everyone is on board all at the same time. In the case of the US, I don't think everyone was on board.",

Almost everyone I spoke with in Jan/Feb told me Covid19 was like the flu and will pass over (like my own family physician). Our government did not take action right away and treated covid19 as a bug that will go away soon with the mindstate that hospitals have \"enough\" PPE. Now, we are starting to take it seriously abeit some time later. \n\nFYI, covid19 seems to be worse than the common flu for the reason that we are still researching the full nature of the virus and its effects.\n\nIf the USA government had taken immediate action for TSA to check for fevers when people were traveling internationally, it would have helped contain spread. If the USA had tried to increase manufacturing of medical supplies and testing kits in the USA early on, I'm wondering if we would still be in this state now. We have competent medical facilities here in our country that more testing kits would have been available early on than now if the CDC shared information about how to make and analyze the kit, which it seems now the CDC is doing. It's sad that a university in Washington state could only test more people if they qualified and participated in a research project a month ago. As SK showed, testing is important, and I'm glad they were very transparent about the infection early on.\n\nIn my opinion, I think it may help if kits were readily available with more drive through stations throughout the country. This would help prevent spread from immunocompromised patients in hospitals.\n\nIt may have taken longer since our country is big, but we would be in a better state than now if we had taken serious action earlier. There's no point in dwelling the past, but to learn from it. Learn how we can respond better if a pandemic may rise again.\n\nAlso, please stop looting neighbors under the guise of health officials, stop hoarding an insane amount of needed supplies, and help each other if you can. If you need to go out, keep a safe distance from one another while wearing gloves and masks. You can DIY masks, and I've seen cool patterned masks (camo, flowers, etc) made by hand. Oh, and also wash your hands!",

The PROBLEM is that not only does Amazon act as a market place for commodities, in many cases, it also acts as a seller for these very same commodities.  So quite often which Amazon removed a listing for selling toilet paper for $50 a roll or sanitizer for $65, you would then instantly find Amazon itself selling these products for $75 and $99 respectively.

The State told me to contact my PCP, I told them he’s recently retired and I’m currently in between PCPs. The rep then told me to call an Urgent Care or an ER. \n\nSo I called an UC, the first one said that they are not doing any COVID19 testing at this location and to call this other location. I call the other location..\n\nMe: I have symptoms consistent with a COVID19 infection and would like to get tested, how would I go about setting that up?\n\nHer (UC Employee): Have you traveled to a high risk country in the last two weeks or had direct contact with a confirmed positive case?\n\nMe: No to the international travel and not to the best of my knowledge about contact with a confirmed positive case. \n\nHer: Do you have a fever of *at least 104.1*?\n\nMe: Did you say ‘one hundred point four’ or ‘one hundred and four point one’?\n\nHer: One hundred and four point one\n\nMe: No, I do not have a 104.1 fever\n\nHer: You aren’t eligible to be tested then, you can just go to the other UC location to be seen by a Doctor for your symptoms. \n\nMe: So, there is no way I can be tested then?\n\nHer: No, and they will take your temperature when you arrive and will turn you away if you don’t have at least a 104.1 Fever. \n\nSo, even though this infection is initially asymptomatic, the fact that I’m not circling the drain with a 104.1 fever makes me ineligible for testing. The fact that the US has only tested around 25k people total, vs South Korea’s over 240k, makes the probability of meeting the direct contact with a positive test case criteria virtually impossible to meet.\n\nI can speak for my state, Florida is not following the CDC’s guidance on testing criteria, this is despite our Governor stating that anyone who wants a test can get one. What’s worse it appears that the criteria varies by medical center, which further adds to the confusion. \n\nSo I’m staying home and self-isolating because I’m fairly sure I have it, and don’t want to go into the ‘non-COVID19’ designated UC and risk either infecting others or, if by chance I don’t have it, catching it from someone else who was similarly turned away by the unreasonably stringent testing criteria. \n\nI am by no means an anomaly, I have spoken to family and friends across the country with similar difficulties getting tested. I hope this gets better but given my personal experience, these poorly thought out testing criteria, lack of test kits, and just abysmal communication at each level of government. I have zero doubts that this will spread and be much worse than it had to be if we were only better prepared. \n\nHope you all stay safe and good luck.\n\nEDIT typos",

Federal agencies jockeyed over who was in charge. State officials and hospitals struggled to figure out what kind of equipment was stockpiled or available. Cities and states went their own ways on school closings.\n\n>> Many of the potentially deadly consequences of a failure to address the shortcomings are now playing out in all-too-real fashion across the country.

The WHO this week urged all countries to test aggressively, noting that South Korea and Taiwan were having success in limiting infections by doing so. “Our key message is: test, test, test,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO chief, said on Monday.\n\nProf Crisanti said the unusual — and in some ways accidental — testing experiment in Vò allowed researchers to obtain a full “epidemiological picture” of the disease.\n\nThe testing began as a scrambled contingency measure after Italy’s first virus-related death there on February 22. It is unclear why northern Italy experienced a surge in cases ahead of other parts of Europe, although Prof Crisanti and others have suggested it may be because of close commercial ties to China.\n\nThe first testing round, carried out on the town’s entire population in late February, found 3 per cent of the population infected, though half of the carriers had no symptoms. After isolating all those infected, the second testing round about 10 days later showed the infection rate had dropped to 0.3 per cent.\n\nImportantly, however, this second round identified at least six individuals who had the virus but no symptoms, meaning they could be quarantined. “If they hadn’t been identified, the infection would have resumed,” explained Prof Crisanti.\n\nPlease use the sharing tools found via the share button at the top or side of articles.

Dorit Nitzan, WHO health emergencies co-ordinator for Europe, said that because so little was known about the coronavirus it was “not the right time for us to recommend” a herd immunity approach. “It is a new virus and we have to learn,” she said.\n\nBritain has not been testing people with mild symptoms but is focusing on patients with serious respiratory illness. However, an abrupt reversal of policy by Boris Johnson’s government this week will see the UK increase testing as part of its efforts to stop new infections and “flatten the curve” so as not to overburden health services and to reduce fatalities.\n\nIn Veneto, the authorities plan to expand the aggressive testing regime in the whole region and are seeking to take at least 11,000 swabs a day. “If someone calls the [virus] hotline and says they are sick then everyone in the family, all their friends and the whole building get tested,” said Prof Crisanti.\n\nLuca Zaia, president of Veneto who initiated the Vò project, on Tuesday reinforced the position that widespread testing was vital. “An asymptomatic carrier can infect 10 people,” he told reporters. “Swabs can save lives.”",

Because it works. It's been disheartening to read comments from concerned haters with excuses like:-\n\n1. **We don't have enough tests here in xxx country** \\- WTF! you've had 3+ months warning and this is still your excuse? If you can't develop them buy them or ask overseas governments or private industry to sell/give them to you. I know lots of local pharmaceutical companies or labs (Gates Foundation, University of Washington etc.) that have offered the tests in the USA only to be turned down by (of all things) our stupid government until public pressure got so bad they kind of gave in. Listen, morons! Testing is the only way to find out who the spreaders are!\n2. **We can't quarantine** \\- YES YOU CAN, unless you're a jellyfish. If they can't be responsible, either put them somewhere or put guards outside their homes. If that fails then \"leak\" their pictures out on social media and the public will take care of them one way or another. I wouldn't want any innocent people to die because some morons were selfish and irresponsible.\n3. **It's already too late** \\- No, it's not. It's never too late. Apathy is not an excuse, you lazy quitters! Start now, and maybe start small (town by town, restrict any movements in and out). Begin with semi isolated small communities, then move to adjacent communities. With one success story, expand the program to another town, then another.\n4. **We don't have the resources to do this or the federal government won't let us** \\- It's not up to them. When they're as ineffective as they have been, perhaps it is time for the locals to take charge, after all it's not like you can do an even worse job than the incompetent morons currently in charge. Have a town hall. Take a vote. Figure out how to get tests and fund it. Figure out when the test will be administered. Publicly identify and socially avoid all those who don't want to be tested.\n\nFor those who are too scared or do not want to be tested, if you or your loved ones either contract or spread this disease and anyone gets sick or dies, you take the blame to your grave.",

I love my mom to death but if there was only one test left, I would understand why it would need to go to a more important person. F'n sucks but what can I do.\n\n\nI'm also not ignorant to the fact the the rich could def pay the bucks or get special treatment to get tested but I also think we should not get so worked up over this.

That chain had 1750 people isolated and tested. If he met his brother, they tested the brother's colleagues, neighbours or whoever he met, but they also tracked the shared cabs these first contacts had taken and tested Co-passengers and such. \n\nThe cases have still risen to 125 in just 3 weeks. Without testing and isolating these people who knows what the situation would have been. \n\nBut don't just go by numbers. India is a third of Europe in total area. The total population of Europe is 747.5 million whereas India is 1.35 billion (almost double). Yet, our infection rate is 0.1% per million. \n\nThere's only a 125 cases and with such stringent checks and tests the government has still closed everything, clubs, malls, gyms, gatherings of more than 50 people. The only thing allowed is weddings that were pre-planned and they're requesting to postpone those. Workplaces are open but as much as possible people are working from home. \n\nIt's already ghost towns here. I don't think anyone is taking this lightly here. I wonder what these so called First World, advanced, rich countries were doing all this while. I'm seriously more worried for people staying in America and Europe than my own country.

I’m posting it here as it may be of some interest. \n\n\n>\t\nDo you think if the Queen dies during this pandemic, it will have a devastating effect on the traditional funeral industry? I do and here’s why. \nI will preface this by saying I am a dual Canadian and British citizen so it is likely my self perceived insight in this is biased. However, I don’t think could name another person who’s death will be the biggest funeral event in our lifetime. She has been the only monarch most of us have known. It has been a pet theory of mine that her funeral, one which has been planned for decades, down to the smallest details, could help increase the popularity of lavish traditional funerals again. Envision the celebrities and heads of states attending, the superficial coverage of who wore what. When Queen Victoria’s Albert died, she made an immediate impact on “mourning culture” and that impact, although waning, has endured into the modern era of funeral directing. Also consider Abraham Lincoln’s funeral train and how it created a surge of interest in the embalming technology that made it possible. \nGetting back to Queen Elizabeth, when she dies the entire commonwealth will be in mourning. Even those who may not be overtly pro monarchist will feel the impact. \nNow consider what her funeral would look like if it happened today. Millions of people could not line the streets. Heads of state and prominent people who would typically attend will be socially pressured not to. We will be in mourning and millions will be denied the expected outlet to express this grief. It will set new social expectations. \nConversely if she outlives this pandemic and life goes back to normal, I really do believe her funeral will give new life into fading funeral traditions.",

They have also updated their sick leave policy for the coronavirus to include 2 weeks of paid leave and unlimited unpaid leave, which is on par with what other companies are doing.

He pointed to all this and said that this was proof that life was going on as usual and that I was panicking about nothing. He said that people like me were really the only thing he worried about. He claims I have been infected with a virus, but the virus was media and it had caused me to be delusional. He worried about my mental health. (I have no mental health issues that go farther than regular folks.)  At the end of the night after sharing all his worries I stated I would still be self quarantining because I have a son who is very immune compromised. We soft argued a bit.

Waking up to all of this earlier this morning was quite a surprise.\n\nWe're an alternative digital publication and very small business based in Dallas. We published the article above in place of our normal weekly \"Things To Do In Dallas This Week\" series, which is hands down our biggest tentpole — a lot of our coverage is event-driven. \n\nThat said, as several of you have mentioned here, people are still going out. So we chose to instead encourage people to stay home, and to meet this moment with responsibility, selflessness and pragmatism. We hope you will do the same if/when possible. \n\nMuch like so many small businesses right now, we are already feeling the blows of this pandemic. Ironically, on a day we attracted so many new viewers, our main source of revenue has come to a halt as event advertisers have (rightfully) halted the advertising of now-postponed/cancelled events. So, [we've started a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/centraltrack) for anyone interested in helping us to keep this thing going. If you're a Dallas-Fort Worth resident or just want to support a small business in these trying times, we really appreciate your support. \n\nIf you can't support us through Patreon, no love lost! You can support our work on social media through following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/central_track) (@/Central\\_Track), [Instagram](https://Instagram.com/centraltrack) (@/CentralTrack) or on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/centraltracker) at (/centraltracker). \n\nAlso, if you have any ideas, tips or suggestions for how your community is navigating through these times, please share them with me either here or on twitter at [@/alecspicey](https://twitter.com/alecspicey). A lot of our content for the foreseeable future will be focused on resources and updates for our community. As mentioned in our story in this subreddit, we're looking for ways to help small businesses, service industry workers, freelancers, musicians, artists etc. to do what we can to help, and I welcome your feedback!\n\nThank you again for reading our work. \n\nStay safe, and wash your damn hands.",

I didn't know why, and I still don't for sure, but I came across a conversation on two scenarios being treated as binary relative to their impact on economic downfall: 1) rapid, widespread testing, early quarantining and treatment, and 2) no testing, allowance of deliberate mass infection, rapid, widespread death at a vastly higher percentage, followed by a fairly broad, though speedier, recovery period.  \n\nThe US has chosen option 2.  The charts associated with these options suggested that per current predictions, the second option will be vastly more costly in terms of loss of life, but will allow the economy to rebound more rapidly.  Further, and this is especially horrifying, part of the implied rationale for selecting option 2 was that the deaths will mainly take place among those the government is supporting, have pre-existing conditions, and aren't earning active income.  \n\nI can't weigh in on the plausibility of these scenarios (like can anyone really predict speed of rebound with this?  We don't even know long-term sequelae yet), but it's jived with the rhetoric POTUS keeps throwing down.   And also jives with the reticence to perform any testing, or obtain functioning tests.  We have the most sophisticated scientific infrastructure in the world, and there's no way to even argue that the deliberate decision to not perform testing or surveillance was anything but that: a deliberate decision.  We haven't even been performing temperature checks off international flights.  \n\nWe also aren't the only country using this strategy.  It's fairly widespread.  But that doesn't stop it from being heartbreaking.  As has been seen in the last 36h, the states have had, ready to deploy, accurate tests, lab personnel, and laboratory space.

The latter aren't available, so why bother mentioning them.  That's pretty much it.\n\nBesides for missing PPE, with 35 million announced by the president NOT being over and above what 3M makes, but that's all that 3M makes.  35MM in a month in the US vs 200MM in a month in China.  Yes, this will be a fiasco.\n\nThe other huge area of very, very, very high probability mortality is that for many like half of those over 70, there are no ventilators/respirators, and no respiratory technicians.  No PPE, no technicians at all.  ARDS has a 70% mortality rate, even with hospitalization.  That mortality rate drops to 30% if there's a respirator available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHERE WON'T BE MORE VENTILATORS.  We need 50,000 at minimum, maybe a quarter million, and we have 10,000, maybe 20,000.  Today, the idiot president said he wanted more PPE faster!.  I want the moon to be a full moon for an entire month.  Neither will happen.  Trump is reckless by defrauding the public.

NYTimes\n\nDow Constantine, the executive of King County, said he had signed an emergency declaration for the county, which was preparing to buy a motel in the Seattle area where people who were infected with coronavirus could stay to remain isolated.\n\nHe said officials also were considering using modular housing units for residents in need of isolation but not hospitalization, as a way to free up access to medical facilities. “We need that hospital capacity for treatment,” Mr. Constantine said.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/coronavirus-washington-state.html?emc=edit\\_na\\_20200302&ref=cta&nl=breaking-news&campaign\\_id=60&instance\\_id=0&segment\\_id=21796&user\\_id=533451648bde7d25472c53df7ba7f3ae&regi\\_id=59038800](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/coronavirus-washington-state.html?emc=edit_na_20200302&ref=cta&nl=breaking-news&campaign_id=60&instance_id=0&segment_id=21796&user_id=533451648bde7d25472c53df7ba7f3ae&regi_id=59038800)\n\nMy point is being proven by the minute.  The deceased in Seattle are out of a nursing home.  They became infected and promptly experienced immediately ARDS.  There are limited ventilators.  The situation required 6-10.

Meaning the usual: Hugging and kissing when the new year comes, going to huge parties; individually visiting each and every single one of your relatives with pastries and eating finger foods (fruits, nuts, sweets)- especially the elderly housebound ones!- European style kiss greetings of aforementioned relatives; giving presents (traditionally banknotes); going on holidays; expats visiting Iran to see their relatives; handicraft fairs; street food stalls- you know, usual fun holiday stuff. And everyone's had a shit year, no one wants to fucking cancel the equivalent of Christmas.\n\nLeast of all elderly Iranians. Your average Iranian granny will respond to the idea by crying and saying who cares, she's going to die soon anyway, everyone dies of something,  what does she have to live for if her family wont come near her even on Nourouz, in fact she'll pray for God to kill her anyway, at least she wouldn't be a burden like she would be if she got cancer like so and so who died so slowly and horribly ECT ECT ECT. Iranians are a fatalistic bunch and don't like making their mothers cry. So, well, good luck with that. lol",

Even if the situation since 1919 has changed and families will still need to bring children together, it won't be as bad as in schools.\n\nBut hey, in our country we get told children don't get that sick so why bother!

There is almost no preventative measures in place and the small ones that are, aren't even being enforced. \n\nWe have signs around about social distancing, and we have been given an abundance of sanitiser but how can you stop the spread when everyone is going crazy with buying at the moment. Our store is way busier than normal with customers. \n\nAll our staff are overworked and super stressed. From checkout operators to stock fillers. \n\nYou can't keep any distance from customers when they're packed in the store and constantly asking for help and for items. Especially on checkout where you have hundreds of people going through.\n\nIt seems absurd that we are still working, and I understand that if people can't access their items it would shatter the economy. At the same time our company is making a boat load of money from this. Surely there should be way more preventative measures in place but people just aren't taking this seriously enough.\n\nFor example, my store manager held a meeting with the stock fillers a few days ago, and while he was standing there talking he coughed. Then talked. Then coughed again. Not covering his mouth or anything just a cough straight forwards. Then said \"Don't worry I don't have Corona disease.\"\n\nCrazy. Australia is going to end up getting hit hard with Covid-19 soon. I just don't understand why we aren't doing more to prevent it.\n \nWe could minimise customers in store, be able to wear masks, only take card instead of cash and card, only use self serve checkouts, roster stock fillers when the store is actually closed.

That won't happen until either most people are infected or people start wearing protection in the limited social interaction: grocery shopping, essential working, etc. \n\nFor various reasons, the CDC has recommended people to not wearing masks. However, things are changing and there are more evidence now that masks helps:\n\n1. Masks can reduce the amount of droplets you inhale and contact with your mouth and nose. It is never one virus that get you sick, it is the amount of virus that matters, reducing the amount of droplets will reduce the risk.\n2. There are more people infected every minutes and it grows exponentially, and most of infected people are asymptomatic. That means everyone, me and you, or anyone you come to contact remotely, however healthy one looks, can actually be infected and contagious. Masks protect others.\n3. Masks shows you care, and can be a sign of safety. If you have to take take-outs or food delivered, do you prefer someone with masks or without? As things goes, the society can start requiring masks for grocery and other places, make it safer for people who have to go out. \n4. With the current shelter-in-place policy, the chance to go out is already very low, masks supply is lesser a problem than before. Anything that can cover your mouth and nose is better than nothing: masks, scarves, pillow strapped on your faces.\n\nCan we pull this off?",

Reading ALL posts in \"Hot\" and then \"rising\" and then \"new\"... and then once i am done i have to refresh \"rising\" again because there is new stuff constantly.

Reddit easily consumes 15 hrs a day for me reading and refreshing... let alone be bored and \"playing card games\" or \"cooking\" or whatever bullshit other people do... And I fall asleep reading it... and if i wake up in the middle of the night i have to read \"rising\" to see if i missed out or if something crazy happened while i slept and when i wake up i need a few hrs just to catch up... i really like reading/refreshing Reddit all day.",
