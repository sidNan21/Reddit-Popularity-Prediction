Whooping cough, pneumonia (multiple times), H1N1. I *always* begin to feel improvement by day three. Even with pneumonia, when I start antibiotics, I've historically felt better within a day of beginning treatment. This was different. My condition continued to worsen for a week.

It's been months and I'm still ten times more tired than I was before, and I had chronic fatigue already, so this is unbearable. In total my illness lasted nearly a month. I had contact with a friend whose parents had recently returned from China two weeks prior to my symptoms. I was fortunate to be able to isolate during my illness, as my roommate was away for the holidays. We know now community spread where I live has reached as far back as late January. I wouldn't be surprised if it reached back further, considering how widespread human transit has become. \n\nWE can't begin to accurately trace this disease till we start looking at older cases. I've heard reports of ER and ICU doctors, a few months ago, commenting on this being a \"particularly bad flu season\" and being shocked that so many \"young healthy twenty somethings have had to come in\".

These can be considered \"facts.\"\n\nMy \\*expectation\\* is around half of Italy was infected by COVID-19, or 30 million people.  Of these, around 10,000 were killed by it.  However, of Italy's typical death count of 1,500 deaths daily, approximately 750 deaths per day will be COVID-19 positive for the next 30-40 years.  We must factor out the benign COVID-19 infections that did not cause death, before we arrive at the true mortality rate of the COVID-19 virus.  This is my opinion only.  I do not think we will confirm that COVID-19 is particularly deadly or dangerous.  I think this is being overblown without any suitable quantitative basis.",

His opinion somehow matters because he’s a doctor that gives advice, I believe he’s in the psych field, which means he’s not a frontline medical specialist dealing with infectious diseases. I believe he is fairly intelligent and gives some decent advice when it comes to general mental health. He let his ego take over in  his desire to remain relevant during this time. It’s worth noting that many celebrities are having a difficult time expressing themselves during this common experience that the world is currently in the grip of. Turns out, at least to myself, that celebrity is pretty useless. We have a president that somehow became one, he never even was an actor, professionally. He became a name for his attitude and his outrageous public statements, well before he ever even had a Tv show. Dr Drew isn’t a bad guy, maybe not as smart as we were led to believe he was, and definitely did not do his research on the subject at hand, at least he sort of apologized for some of foolish statements. But he’s just a celebrity doctor, I wouldn’t go to any doctor that has an ego driving his focus. A doctor who has made his career into being famous instead of actual health care. Also I won’t vote for loud, lewd, obnoxious, and obvious, criminals to be in seats of power of any sort, especially not the most powerful chair. But here we are, and look where it’s taking us. I hope everyone is staying safe, I feel like things are about to get a little worse, and then much worse. I hope we make some responsible choices from the aftermath. I hope I’m alive to see it. I still have hope. Wash your hands, avoid public gatherings, be kind and respectful to one another, and don’t let these ego driven, selfish people upset you, their opinions are worth not a bit, they just want you to notice them, because without us, they are not important to anyone that doesn’t personally know them, just like everyone else.",
