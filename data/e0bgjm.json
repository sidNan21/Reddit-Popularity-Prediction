LeBron has shown no indication he could play QB at even a below average level. Like I know this is a basketball sub but we gotta stop thinking NBA players can actually play NFL football. There's a reason when LeBron did play football he was a WR. QB is the hardest position to play in sports by a mile and there is a reason why QB's who played great in college sucked in the NFL.",

Being \"the most famous\" doesn't exempt him from criticism. He's hardly the only player known for his flopping; James Harden is arguably worse. But Harden is about 220 while James is listed at 250. His actual weight is rumored to be closer to 265, and that's after off season weight loss. A guy that big and strong shouldn't be flying through the air like Bluto getting punched by Popeye every time he gets bumped. If he doesn't want to be known for flopping (which he doesn't seem to mind actually) the solution is simple. Stop flopping. And if he continues to flop people will criticize him for it. As they should.",

Shaq did not get the calls he deserved for the same reason. Eventually he’s going to get tired of getting smacked around without a call. Players are clearly more rewarded for flopping and embellishing contact than they are punished for it, so they would be stupid not to try and get themselves free points.",
