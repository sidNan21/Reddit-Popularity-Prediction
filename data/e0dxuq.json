Bev is running in front of him, and Harden's left foot catches the front of Bev's trailing leg. Bev goes flying into PG13, and Harden gets spun around and taken down by his contact with Bev. I give all credit to Harden, he takes basketball to another level with his craft and he deserves all the fouls he's getting. The fact that everyone ITT is saying Bev had his ankles broken is just testament to how amazing Harden is at what he does.",

Beverly didn't even try to argue. It was a terrible contest. He tried to contest the shot by crossing directly in front of Harden.

I went back to the old play where he absolutely destroys Johnson and stares him down before taking the shot, and you can see how his left leg lands in front of the right even though the shot is as wide-open as could be. There's certainly no foul-hunting going on there. I guess you could argue that Harden might have designed his form to create optimal opportunities for contact, but it's not easy to permanently modify your shot like that. It's certainly not something he just does when he feels like it, that's my point.https://i.imgur.com/Ru4r1va.jpg",

One leg is always in front of the other when he shoots. His right leg often doesn't move much at all, which makes it easy for people to notice his left leg in front and accuse him of kicking out more often than he does.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vxOrWpc.jpg\n\n\nBtw, I hope you realize that shooting a stepback three is difficult enough that you can't just flail your legs and throw off your balance purposefully on random shots and still make anywhere near a decent percentage of them. The fact that Harden gets as many four-point plays as he does is pretty good proof that he is NOT just altering his form and flopping for fouls.",
