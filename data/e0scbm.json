There’s three different rules for 3 different situations where traveling can happen in the nba. Gathering off the dribble, gathering off the catch, and from a stand still with an established pivot foot. This was a gather off the dribble. He gets the ball, dribbles, gains control when the left foot plants (gather step), and takes two legal steps (right, left) before shooting. Clean. It looks like a travel because of the ground he covers, but that move was effectively a hop step three. No different than doing that in the lane.",

And you just react to everything. And the world slows down for you. Its very real. I have always been there as a competitor, I was just not 6'6, lol. I won HS games like this before. Just wasn't big enough physically to go further. But I have used it in plenty of other ways.\n\nBut where I felt it the most important place when when my friends and I got shot at. Long story short, case of mistaken identity , guy pulls out a gun point blank at us as I am driving us near him, and for me the entire world went slow. As he turns the gun on us I just went there without knowing it. My friends were shrieking, and I didn't say a word.They were all background noise, really. I just reacted and drove like I was Neo dodging bullets,as I really WAS dodging bullets, turning the car this way and that way and dipping in and out of cars like I was this amazing race car driver. When it was all over and we were safe I came down and was able to understand what happened. But not while in it. \n\nThat zone is something doctors, lawyers, soldiers, musicians, sports players use, we all have access to it. For some it comes more naturally. \n\nIts damn near close to what that kid was telling Neo: there is no spoon. \n\nYou realize there is no spoon, therefore there is no fear, there is only being at one with the moment. You can then will anything to happen with stunning accuracy. \n\nWhen I put it like that, hopefully more of you can really recognize it.",
