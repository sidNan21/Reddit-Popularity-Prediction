It took him a bit longer than Luka... but after he had that breakout game against the Spurs in the 2010 playoffs where he single-handedly destroyed their entire team to put us up 3-0 and finally break the curse, the hype around him absolutely exploded especially locally.\n\nRan into him at the bars near ASU one night with his fiancé and he was the friendliest most down to earth dude ever. He’s carried himself exactly the same way since he came to the league, super humble and genuinely grateful guy.\n\nIts cool seeing young players handle themselves so well despite being thrust into the spotlight with fame and success.\n\nEven more impressive with Luka. He’s so fucking young and has completely exploded on the scene like no one we’ve seen in a long time.",

The entire team is young though and not great to begin with outside of Love, who doesnt always play, and Clarkson is definitely starting caliber, they need a lot more time to gel and grow. Garland and Porter have good skills but are rough around the edges.\n\nOff ball movement is a problem which causes the offense to stagnate and resort to isolation ball and a lot of 1 on 1 attempts. So it's hard to gauge Sextons ceiling given the state of the team.\n\nHaven't been this excited in a prospect since Kyrie though I'll say that much.",

There have been rumors that this is why the rules keep changing in favor of technical skills and accuracy and discouraging physicality.",

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Šumi Mix bags in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bags and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bag and put them in a grocery bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

Carmelo and Bosh got picked before Wade. \n\nThis is even more exaggerated because Luka had legit pro experience playing for Real Madrid before becoming a rookie. Marvin was in college two years ago. \n\nWould I have done it?
