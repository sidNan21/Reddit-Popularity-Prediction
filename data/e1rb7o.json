Not to be an armchair quarterback and just complain \"all the refs in all the sports suck\", but I love hoops so much, it pisses me off with such crappy calls (and non-calls). Traveling has to be reigned in. So many times, a player will take an in-bounds pass, take about three steps while receiving the ball, then change pivot foot or take a step or two before a dribble. Call that shit! Also, and I know it's been said a million times, but whatever Harden is doing isn't legal. Side note: I remember when Shaq was playing with Orlando, and his games were televised every once in a while in LA, I always thought, \"This guy is just a thug bashing everybody around.\" It wasn't until he got traded to the Lakers, and I watched about 75% of the games, I realized that he was getting freaking hacked and assaulted almost every time he was in the post. He was just so big, they allowed him to get nearly anally probed before they called any foul.",

The only problem is I don't see bulk stats, I see each event, or attempted free throw, and the result. Sorted by team. Sorted again by year.  So. It's a lot. I only had the patience to look through one team for one year, disregarding technical, flagrant, and third free throws; the 2019 Bulls.\n\n|All Free Throws|293 / 384 |76.30% |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|First Attempt|150 / 206|72.82%|\n|Second Attempt|139 / 178|78.09%|\n|Second Attempt Made After First Made|104 / 130|80.00%|\n|Second Attempt Missed After  First Made|26 / 130|20.00%|\n|Second Attempt Made After First Missed|35 / 48|72.92%|\n|Second Attempt Missed After First Missed |13 / 48|27.08%|\n\nSo, keeping in mind the small sample size, it seems to me that the first free throw only slightly affects the second. The difference in success rates is about 7 percent. That's significant, but it's a sample size of less than 400.\n\nIf anyone wants to check my math or add onto it I used these pages ( [1](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/event_finder.cgi?request=1&event_code=fta&year_id=2020&is_playoffs=N&team_id=CHI) , [2](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/event_finder.cgi?request=1&player_id=&id_val=&event_code=fta&year_id=2020&is_playoffs=N&team_id=CHI&opp_id=&quarter=&time_remain_quarter=&margin=&score=&offset=250) ) and [this](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/186320).
