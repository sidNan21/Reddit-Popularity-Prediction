Gasol's block on him in the second was more or less a double, because they had help defense at the rim and Gasol was on his hip. Third quarter was the same way, his first shot was a catch-and-shoot 3 with 17 left on the shot clock. Then he tried to back Gasol down, saw a help defender coming over and decided to launch a fadeaway two. Next he tried to isolate Gasol, no double, and went for a stepback and missed.\n\nThey had help defense waiting at the rim, and the few times Embiid truly posted up and got the ball they brought over a second defender.

The problem is they're both unplayable on defense late in games because they're so bad at it. Also \"blocked shots\" is the dumbest way to measure rim protection. Teams make essentially the same amount of FG's at the rim with Towns vs when his backup is in the game and thats actually a massive improvement. Jokic is the worst rim protector in basketball and Kyle Korver is a better rim protector than he is. Regardless, Towns and Jokic are massively overrated and have fatal flaws defensively.

Obviously he would be your go to guy down the stretch, but their was no spacing with him Joel and Ben on the floor at the same time. Getting Josh in the sign and trade was huge for them imo. Spacing (shooting at nearly a 40% clip) and an elite wing defender was crucial for them, and it’s allowed Furkan to get more chances as well and he’s looked good at times. Josh was an alright first option on a mediocre Heat team but now that he’s a 3rd or 4th option, he’s really showing what he can do.",
