Nurse prefers to not take risks on getting a board and letting the other team get a quick transition bucket, instead the team hustles back right away and gets set up so the opponent has to play a half court set instead.\n\nGiven the increased pace and speed of the game teams are very good at transition buckets now, so Raptors prefer to make them uncomfortable running a set.  It's a big reason why the Raptors defense is one of the better ones in the league and allows for the lowest FG%.

Keeps the offense moving and flowing well with VanVleet as the only playmaker with Lowry out. He also spaces the floor which is pretty valuable as a big man and it opens up the inside for the Raptors young athletic cutters like Powell and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson\n\nKinda like Draymond where hes incredibly valuable if hes not the focus of the offense. Hes a great 5th option.",

His 3 point shooting is still pretty good and his passing prevents him from being a total negative on offense.\n\nBut when he's not up against traditional/traditionally sized big like Embiid or Vucevic, it's his defense that's been the biggest let down. His smarts can only make up for so much and his total lack of footspeed to start the season has been getting him killed in pick and rolls. \n\nTo be fair, we are holding him up against the incredible defensive standard he set last season and his 25 million dollar contract. He's still a perfectly serviceable player and the more reasonable Raptors fans understand his decline this season was the price we paid for the title last year.",

Ben being one of them.\n\nAlso don’t think it’s entirely fair to blame embiid. The raps took everything away and BB made no adjustments, ran no plays to get him easy looks and he and embiid looked like they’d never played together. He definitely quit early on and that’s unforgivable but the sixers staff need to come correct with the game plan. The 76ers have no call to be playing as poorly as they are right now.",

If it looks bad in mid-January, I will be a lot more concerned. Even now, they’re on a 53 win pace which is still better than the last 2 seasons (51,52). \n\nPerformance-wise, Simmons has been a pretty similar player to last year. His perimeter defense looks as elite as it did at the end of last year and he should have a real shot at All-NBA first team all defense. His counting stats have taken a dip due to Horford who is getting a fair amount of the rebounds and even assists (especially top of the key) he had gotten last year. \n\nI’m okay with the contract situation, considering 3/4 of the big money guys are 23,25 and 27. They’ve got decent depth, just need to find one more perimeter creator at the deadline/buyout market.",

Especially considering that Philly is the favorite to come out of East. He can work on this early enough and be more tenacious late in the season and the playoffs (when he's gonna see this a lot more from every team). He knows what the raps can do against him. We played our cards. And it's a good thing for 6ers that we did.. because you can respond to the one flaw in his otherwise stellar game.\n\nBrett is also growing with this team. Last season Jimmy (while as amazing as he was) couldn't let the team be as organic as it has been this season. I liked that Brett had Joel shoot the technical to get him a shot going. That's a coach that trusts his players and nurtures them.",

It's more likely we make it if Tobias or Josh shoots it be he knows that helping Embiid is more important than this one game. Also J-Rich missed three straight free throws on that possession as well so maybe we were just gonna not score that possession lol. \n\nAnyway, I think the Raptors, while not top two favorites, are very good. They have continuity that we certainly do not have yet and are hell to try and beat at home. I don't think every team that isn't a top 4 contender (LA, LA, Milwaukee, Philadelphia) should just give up. I think you guys can be dangerous come playoff time especially if Milwaukee or Philly isn't playing to their potential because of injury, or any other reason. \n\nI hope you guys keep all your players and we can try to beat you in the playoffs. And we'll see you in Philly soon.",

Because I'm afraid you may be putting a tone that I'm not intending, nothing I said on my end was passive aggressive. When I asked what year it was, I was asking because I thought I remembered the game off the top of my head but I wasn't sure -- not trying to say \"Well Larry was a rookie, screw Embiid\"\n\n>And if your internet is so spotty that you can't google when Larry scored 0, meanwhile you're on reddit posting about it, people are going to wonder.\n\nWonder what though? I put in my original comment, with no edit, that I'm not excusing it because he averaged 20ppg as a rookie. I wasn't saying \"Wasn't that his first or second year\" to make an excuse for him compared to Embiid, I said that because I genuinely didn't remember.\n\nI think based on your wording of \"Does that really matter though?\" It's pretty evident you were taking my comment as some sort of rebuttal instead of a question, which is normal on Reddit I suppose but I think you read it as passive aggressive instead of just an actual question.\n\nAnd maybe you're enlightening me into a problem other people don't have? But the Reddit app on my phone is much more stable than using my browser can be, often times my browser can completely pause but apps like Reddit/Twitter will still work fine.",
