I grow weaker and weaker, my head starts to spin. Every 4-5 minutes I rest for 20-25 seconds. Finally, here it is, the cursed appendage! With horror I notice the dark stain at its base. That means just a day longer and it would have burst and ...\nAt the worst moment of removing the appendix I flagged: my heart seized up and noticeably slowed; my hands felt like rubber.

This shows that no matter how GOAT you were in college, you need to at least be decent in pro or international play because if Laettner wasn’t enough... However, Grant Hill made it and his career only had about five years of truly star caliber play but lasted many, many years even after his physical decline, which allowed him to collect enough stats and you have to think that being a household name in college helped. Kemba has been a star for three seasons now. If he plays for a long time, collects a few more All-Star selections (playing in Eastern Conference, esp. Celtics, helps), gets stats, and has some postseason success, his college career will definitely tip him over. He is a bit of a late bloomer, but HoF is definitely possible.",
