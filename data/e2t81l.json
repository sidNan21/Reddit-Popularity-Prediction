There was no angle that showed that he definitely did not hit the elbow.  If he does hit the elbow even slightly, that would affect the shot and would be a foul.  Since a foul was called, it would need to be absolutely definitive to overturn it.  There was nothing wrong with that call not being overturned.  Laker and Lebron fans need to stop with this notion that they get no calls.  Lebron uses his off arm to hold off or push off defenders all the time and never gets called for it.  He had a blatant hook on the block this game and a blatant travel as well.  The scales are far tipped in the Lakers favor as far as calls go this season.  I'm a lifelong Laker fan saying this, by the way.  Lebron should get fined for criticizing the officials as well.",

The money from fines is insignificant to the players and the league. \n\nI'm pretty sure the most anyone has been fined in the league is Mark Cuban, at $2.6 million since he bought the team. Still, that number is nothing compared to his total net worth. He's worth $4.1 billion, so $2.6 million to him is 0.06% of his wealth.

The difference is that the commentators wouldn't fixate on them and there was maybe one shitty replay before moving on. Players weren't jumping around asking for a call on every play (wrs for pi). \n\n\nReffing is fucking hard, and the problem with replay is that we're asking for perfection from an imperfect system. If a ref has been calling a game a certain way all game, then when you isolate one play and it's not by the letter of the law, then you're losing one way the ref has an ability to keep things equal in a way that he can. \n\nI don't think there's a solution. Unfortunately refs are still better than most. College basketball refs are way worse than nba refs. I think high definition replay, along with players playing the rules more than playing the game more than ever, has made it impossible.",

I mean BI’s arm doesn’t even move or react to any supposed contact, so wtf did the ref see? \n\nThe majority of these cases are going to have suboptimal camera coverage given the nature of the game and the pace at which it’s played, so if this is going to be that strict of a process then this entire concept seems poorly thought-out to me. \n\nMaybe they should put a GoPro on these refs or some shit lol.",

If hadn't called a foul, there wouldn't be anything to overturn it that way either.\n\nI also agree that the issue is that this whole challenge system is poorly thought out. Having it for out of bounds plays makes sense because it's an objective call. Fouls are much more subjective though and really hard to judge in slo mo one way or the other.\n\nEither way I find all this bitching about the refs from fans and players pretty immature. There STILL isn't an angle that proves one way or another, yet theres thousands of people calling for the refs jobs based on literally no proof lol",
