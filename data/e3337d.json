I haven't followed his stats to back up the opinion but I feel his posture isn't nowhere near the posture of a bonafide superstar in the league. If he could borrow some of the mentality from Westbrook he'd really step up to the role of the team leader. And while I don't think he'd defensively be near the likes of Kawhi and PG, I still think he has figuring out to do into how to lead a team with the burden of being the best player on the team and a go-to guy to win. There are players in the league who openly hate social media (Kawhi, Jokic) yet they ball out every night and they thrive under pressure in the playoffs.",

I love House of highlights and even barstool sports videos but you sometimes see people your age posts and sometimes you feel that regret if you see them posting about their frat life or this and that. But for me as I am older and do other things, those things aren’t everything and I think Instagram really does paint some misconceptions about life and also affect people’s confidence. Same time I look at these hot fitness girls on Instagram and some of them are shitty as fuck and obnoxious. Like this one girl is hot but one time she posted some snap story About how she ghosted some dude on a date cause she didn’t like him or some Bs. Thing was she could’ve done that and kept it private but she posted it. Like for me instagram is a big part of why people today get sensostive about shot and can’t act rationally at times.",

She eventually found his name(cause she never talked to him) and stalked his IG profile, and when he tried to comment on her page, she locked her account and wouldnt accept his request\n\nSo fast forward, we start catching feelings, but this incident has to be addressed, so I indirectly call her IG handle out. She tries to deflect and pin the issue on me. I do it again a second time to see if she catches on to how I know, she pulls up my full name from work and tries to search me on facebook(didnt work cause I have a nickname in my profile name, but havent used it in over 8 years)\n\nMy boss is cool with me and her, she knows the drama, I know they talked, my boss basically tells me that her feelings are hurt and I should apologize - I still havent apologized to this day",

The Hawks and the Celtics disappeared just as much if not more against LeBron, and they were far less consistent of threats.\n\nBut still, LeBron’s Cavs were in a tier below the Cavs with the Thunder and Rockets, where it felt like they were just trying to counter the dynasty that was GS. And then the rest of the East was a tier below that. \n\nI think what’s more important is how much of an achievement is was for Toronto, than the East in general.

When you have intelligence officials saying 'we have no solid connection between Al-Quada and Saddam' at the same time the Bush Administration is publically talking about Mohammad Atta being associated with the Baathist regime, there's something more than a misunderstanding happening.\n\nIf your argument is that congress is also complicit, I would agree. They all failed in their most basic job as a check of power to the executive branch.",
