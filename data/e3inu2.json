        "body": "Siakam's growth from bad role player, good role player, all star level to now playing mvp caliber ball has been a magical experience for Raptor fans following him throughout the journey. \n\nHas there even been a player who improved his shooting ability significantly EVERY single year? Attempts and percentage alike. I personally thought he peaked last year on 2.7 attempts a game (37%) from a PJ Tucker esque corner shooting only. However, he came this year guns blazing! Pulling up, doing step backs and shooting with defenders draped all over him. All from the top of key which he barely shot from last year. \n\nHis shooting numbers:\n(Attempts from 3)\n\n0.1 on .143%\n\n1.6 on .220%\n\n2.7 on .369%\n\n6.3 on .393%\n\n\n\nTweet source: https://twitter.com/WolstatSun/status/1200097424364261376?s=19",

Paul George is better but I just feel like Pascal's game is built for the playoffs\n\nHe can operate out of the post  where as PG can't really. \n\nHe can score on different ways, he can shoot the three, take you on the post, finish at the rim. Not to mention, he's more efficient with his touches than Paul George. And he's not a bad defender. PG is better but siakam can hold his own.\n\nPG is more of a finesse guy and I worry if his shot isn't falling, what's he gonna do? He can drive to the basket but he doesn't do it as much as Pascal. He doesn't really post guys unless they're super small.",

By mid way through that series they didn't even guard him out there and he was passing open shots to drive into a packed paint waiting for him.  It was like the team was playing 4v5 on offense.  He was still an important part of that team because of his defensive energy, but he really held the team back on offense. Now he leads them on both sides while Kyle's been out.",
